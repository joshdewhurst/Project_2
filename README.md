## Sexual Health Tracking App
### I am thinking of creating an app to track sexual health, possible exposures, and sexual partners. The app will load on a main page prompting log in authentication in order to authorize the use of the app. Once logged in, a monthly calendar will be the main display item. You will have the options to add an encounter, add a new partner, or request information on a STD/STI.
1. The goal of the app is to have your sexual health in an easy to access app that stores information on when an encounter happened and with who in the case you have been exposed to a disease and need to inform people you have been with and be responsible and practice safer sex practices.
